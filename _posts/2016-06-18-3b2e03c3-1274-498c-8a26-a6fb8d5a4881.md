# Decks of Thunder

Automobiles is the third game of AEG's Trains, Planes and Automobiles trilogy of deckbuilders. 

Automobiles is a clever game. Players buy cubes to make their car more reliable and pacy. Much in the same sense a Quarriors, the cubes reference an equivalent card that describe its function. Choosing between flat out movement or specialised abilities, players pick cubes with the aim of being the first to cross the finish line after a predetermined number of laps. 

Like all deckbuilders players need to think about probability carefully managing the concentration or dilution of there deck (or in this case pouch of cubes). Like the others of this series, Automobiles uses a board to add a 2D aspect to this otherwise spatially agnostic genre. This works as well in this games as it did in Trains. 

The game works well with any of the recommended numbers of players, though the experience is quite different with each additional player from the minimal two. Additionally there are four of each special card type (5 types in total) making for a reasonable amount of variety in replay. 

However this is not a flawless game.

The manual isn't the easiest to read, doing a good job of convincing you that something very simple is anything but. Realistically you may need to read the rules through a couple of time to get there.

And the component quality and construction suffers a bit for its price point. I'd be happier paying a little extra to have cubes that are not subject to poor paint quality or sharding. This said AEG's complaints dept seem to be happy to send more cubes on request for affected customers. 

Overall, mechanically this is an excellent game. it performs well in thematic representation, novalty and innovation and flat out fun. I'd like to have better quality components and with a price tag of around Â£35 I think there would have been room to improve by adding more cards and better quality cubes. It makes me feel that AEG are holding back for the already announced expansion set. 

All in all I give this 8 of 11\. Definately worth the money, but you may want to replace some of the components yourself.
